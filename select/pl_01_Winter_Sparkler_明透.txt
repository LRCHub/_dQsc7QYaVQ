Winter Sparkler 見つめていま
Unsent love letter
伝えたいな
不意な言葉も
たまの気まぐれも
It makes a crackling noise
in my mind. baby
Outside is freezing for sure
Why don't we cuddle for warmth?
No. I'd never
dare to request that
Without my knowing why
いつか蕾ほころび
Our time is going by
ひとひら　また落ちる
Winter Sparkler 見つめていま
わたしの肩には初雪
Unsent love letter
伝えたいな
愛すべき冬の光あびて
へたな言い訳と
曖昧な答えと
I'll keep my wishlist private.
you know why? baby
Something money can't buy
Something I'm wanting for life
No. I'd never
dare to confess that
In this festive atmosphere
Can I let go of the fear?
As my breath gets whter here
My cheeks are turning red
I feel you near
If only I could surrender
myself to the season
Something magical would happen
White sparkler. your brief yet
beautiful span of life
Without my knowing why
静かに想い育ち
Our time is going by
いとしさ　花ひらく
Winter Sparkler 見つめていま
あなたの肩にも初雪
Unsent love letter
伝えたいな
愛すべき冬の光
Dear my love.
I should've
told you way before
I love you
